Final Project Logixx Games

Group 7 
Beverly Wertz - designed the tic tac toe and kukuro games along with its UI components
Jordan Taylor - designed the akari game along with its UI components
Kyle Teegardin - designed the sudoku game along with its UI components


All members assisted, provided input for and participated throughout the design/coding/development process on all forms/classes/functions.

To Compile and Run: 
Extract all documents ensuring that the file structure remains intact, otherwise data may not be accessed properly.
Ensure that QT Creator is installed and open the finalproject2 folder. 
Open the LogixxGames.pro file - this is the main project file for the QT project. 
Do not say yes to loading the settings option - instead, select no and use default environment options for the desktop option. 
The program should now be able to build and execute.
